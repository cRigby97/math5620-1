    Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics:
                         Tasksheet 4 Problem/Questions
  </h1>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 1: Determine if there might be an advantage to using one of the
         hybrid methods for root finding for the problem defined in Task 7 on
         Tasksheet 3. Justify your answer with results from your codes.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 2: Develop codes to compute the length of a vector of arbitrary
         length using the 1-norm, 2-norm, and infinity norm. Add the object
         modules to your shared library and create three pages to put in your
         software manual.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 3: Develop codes that compute the absolute and relative error
         in using one vector ${\bf x}$ as an approximation of another vector,
         ${\bf x^*}$. Create these routines for the 1-norm, 2-norm, and infinity
         norm. Make sure you add these routines to your shared library and 
         create software manual pages for all 6 codes.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 4: Write codes that return (1) the sum of two vectore, (2)
         difference of two vectors, and (3) a scalar multiple of a vector.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 5: Wrte a code that implements a "SAXPY" operation involing input
         of a couple of vectors and a scalar. Do an internet search to find out
         what a SAXPY operation. Add the routine to your shared library and the
         software manual.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 6: Write codes to implement (1) the dot product of two vectors
         and (2) the cross product of two vectors. As usual, add these to your
         shared library and software manual.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 7: Create a routine that will return the output from multiplying
         a matrix into a vector from the left. Do this for a general rectangular
         matrix, $A$. That is,
         $$
           {\bf y} = A\ {\bf x}
         $$
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 8: Download and use the "Hello World" handout that uses OpenMP to
         do a single print of a string for each processor your computer has.
         Report how many processors your laptop or desktop has.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 9: Use OpenMP to try to speed up the matrix-vector multiplication
         using more than one processor.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 10: Search the internet for sites that document optimization flags
         on compilers that you might use. For example, look for pages that
         talk about optimization flags on gcc or gfortran. Write a brief
         paragraph (3 or 4 sentences) that describe your findings. Include links
         to the sites you cite.
    </li>
