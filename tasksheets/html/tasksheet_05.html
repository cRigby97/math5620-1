    Math 5620 Numerical Methods for the Approximate Solution of Differential
       Equations: Tasksheet 5 Problem/Questions
  </h1>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 1: Write a finite difference code for the nonlinear elliptic
         problem
         \[
           \theta''(t) + {g\over l}\ sin(\theta(t)) = 0
         \]
         with \(\theta(0)=1\) and \(theta(2)=-1\). Use \(g/l=1\).
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 2: Simplify the problem in Task 1 using the small angle assumption
         \( sin(\theta)\approx\theta\).
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 3: Let's start into approximate solution of partial difference
         equations. With the simplest equation,
         \[
            \Delta\ u = {{\partial u}\over{\partial x^2}}
                             + {{\partial u}\over{\partial y^2}} = f(x,y)
         \]
         Start by writing a code to initialize the associated pentadiagonal
         matrix using central differences. Do this using the sparse storage
         into 5 vectors. Also, write a routine that initializes the right hand
         side of the system of equations.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 4: Write a routine that implements Jacobi iteration for the
         approximate solution linear systems of equations.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 5: Write a code that solves the elliptic problem in Task 1 using
         your Jacobi iteration. Use \(f(x,y)=xy\) and homogeneous boundary
         conditions.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 6: Search the internet for discussions of using finite difference
         methods for elliptic operators. Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4
         sentences) that describes your findings. Include links to the sites
         you cite.
    </li>
