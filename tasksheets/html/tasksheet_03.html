    Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics:
                         Tasksheet 3 Problem/Questions
  </h1>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 1: Implement a version of Newton's method for finding the roots of
         a function of one variable. Document the code in your software manual.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 2: Implement a version of the secant method for finding the roots
         of a function of one variable. Create a page in your software manual
         to document the code.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 3: Compare the 4 methods for root finding (functional iteration,
         bisection, Newton's method, and the secant method using the problems
         defined in the first two tasks of Task sheet #2. 
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 4: Develop and implement a hybrid method for approximate solution
         of root finding problems in one variable. Use the bisection method to
         start the algorithm and switch to Newton's method when the iterates
         are close enough. Create a page in your software manual for this code.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 5: Repeat the development in Task 4, but replace Newton's method
         with the secant method. Create a page in your software manual for this
         code.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 6: Add the routines created thus far to your shared library. There
         should be 8 to 10 routines so far in the course.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 7: In some cases it is necessary to find a number of roots for a
         function of one variable. Suppose that we know there are several roots
         in a given interval. Develop code that will break the interval into
         subintervals and apply the Bisection method to each subinterval. Apply
         this to the following function
         $$
           f(x) = sin(\pi x^2+3.7)
         $$
         Use the interval $[1.1, 68.3]$.
         It might pay to identify where the zeros are in this problem. 
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 8: Repeat the work from Task 7 using Newton's method.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 9: Repeat the work from Task 7. using the secant method.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 10: Search the internet for sites that identify real problems
         where some root finding problem is used to compute approximate
         solutions. Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4 sentences) that describe
         your findings. Include links to the sites you cite.
    </li>
