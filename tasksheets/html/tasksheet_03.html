    Math 5620 Numerical Methods for the Approximate Solution of Differential
       Equations: Tasksheet 3 Problem/Questions
  </h1>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 1: For the tridiagonal matrix that arises from the central
         difference applied to the elliptic problem
         \[
           u'' = f(x)
         \]
         on $[0,1]$ develop an algorithm that performs the LU decomposition of
         the coefficient matrix. Also, develop the forward and backward
         substitution methods to go along with the LU factorization.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 2: Apply the code from the previous task to the case where
         \(f(x)=0\) and \(u(0)=1\) and \(u(1)=3\). Use some graphing utility to
         display your results. Do this for varying numbers of mesh points.
         Make the coarsest mesh size \(h=1/8\) and refine to \(h=1/256\).
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 3: Repeat the previous task with $f(x)=10.0\ sin(2\pi x)\) and
         use homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 4: Repeat the previous two tasks combining \(f(x)\) from Task 3
         with the boundary conditions given in Task 2.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 5: Create a new code from the elliptic problem with Neumann
         boundary conditions. Using the same data as in Task 4 test your code
         using homogeneous Neumann conditions. Also, run a test case for unit
         fluxes at both ends of the domain. 
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 6: Search the internet for discussions of handling Dirichlet 
         versus Neumann conditions. Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4 sentences)
         that describes your findings. Include links to the sites you cite.
    </li>
