    Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics:
                         Tasksheet 2 Problem/Questions
  </h1>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 1: Consider the nonlinear equation
         $$x \cosh(x) + x^3 = \pi$$.
         Set up a root finding problem for this equation. This task does not
         require any code.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 2: Consider the nonlinear equation
         $$x \cosh(x) + x^3 = \pi$$.
         Set up at least two associated fixed point iteration for this equation.
         You do not need to write a code for this problem.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 3: Write code that implements fixed point iteration for the
         equation defined in the previous two tasks. Try out the method on the
         fixed point iteration equations in Task 1 and Task 2. Make sure that
         the code you write is in the form of a method or subroutine that can
         be added to your shared library. You should also write a main program
         to test the code.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 4: Write a code that computes the roots of a function of one
         variable using the Bisection method. The algorithm should be written
         into a subroutine or method that can be called from a main program.
         Include the routine in the shared library that you are creating for the
         course.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 5: Start your software manual by including the routines you have
         written for computing the single precision machine epsilon and double
         precision machine epsilon. Use the template provided in the math4610
         repository for the course. 
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 6: Add pages in your software manual that document the routines
         created for absolute error and relative error.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 7: Complete pages in your software manual that document the
         code written for functional iteration for finding the roots of a
         function of a single real variable. Use the results in Task 3 as
         examples for the software page.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 8: Repeat Task 7 for the Bisection method.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 9: Compare the results from functional iteration and Bisection
         on the problems in Tasksheet 2, Task 1 and Task2. Which provides a
         better approximation and on the efficiency of the methods. 
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 10: Search the internet for sites that discuss functional
         iteration for root finding. Try to find sites that show the effective
         use of this method in real problems. Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4
         sentences) that describe your findings. Include links to the sites you
         cite.
    </li>
