    Math 5620 Numerical Methods for the Approximate Solution of Differential
       Equations: Tasksheet 2 Problem/Questions
  </h1>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 1: Build a code that will initialize the tridiagonal matrix for
         the simple elliptic ordinary differential equation in the textbook.
         Use the array storage version of the matrix storage. Also implement the
         code that initializes the right hand side vector. Make the code
         reusable
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 2: Implement an algorithm for solving the linear system in the
         book for the elliptic problem.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 3: Write up the results that you obtain in the approximate
         solution of the elliptic problem.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 4: Write a code that will compute the coefficients for a finite
         difference approximation of a given derivative. There is a version of
         the code (in  Matlab) that will do the job. If you use Matlab to get
         this done, expand out all of the shorthand notation that Matblab uses. 
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 5: Write up a software manual page (we will go through a template
         in class. Put pages in for the codes you have written for this homework
         assignment.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 6: Search the internet for applications that involve modeling real
         physical processes with a simple elliptic ODE. Write a brief paragraph
         (3 or 4 sentences) that describes your findings. Include links to the
         sites you cite.
    </li>
