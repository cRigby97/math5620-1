  </h1>

  <ul>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 1: Write a method/routine that will compute the solution of a
         square linear systems of equations where the coefficient matrix is
         diagonal. Put an entry in your software manual that documents the
         method for diagonal systems.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 2: Write a method/routine that will compute the solution of an
         upper triangular system (the coefficient matrix is upper triangular)
         and put an entry in your software manual to document the routine.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 3: Repeat the previous task, but in the case of a lower triangular
         coefficient matrix.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 4: Write a routine that will row reduce a square matrix into row
         echelon form. Include a page in your software manual.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 5: Write a code that will solve a square linaer system of
         equations using Gaussian elimination (elementary row operations). Use
         your backsubstitution method to compute the solution. Note that the
         first part will result in an upper triangular system. Document the code
         in your software manual.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 6: Write a routine that will compute the LU-factorization of a
         square matrix. Put an entry in your software manual to document the
         code.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 7: Create a routine that will solve a linear system of equations
         using the LU-factorization. Make sure you include a page in your
         software manual.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 8: Using OpenMP, see if you can speed up the LU-factorization 
         solution method from the previous task.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 9: Embed scaled partial pivoting in a new version of the
         LU-factorization linear solution method. using more than one processor.
         Do this without interchanging rows - use an index vector to improve
         efficiency.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 10: Search the internet for sites that document pivoting
         strategies in numerical solution of linear equations.  Write a brief
         paragraph (3 or 4 sentences) that describe your findings. Include links
         to the sites you cite.
    </li>
