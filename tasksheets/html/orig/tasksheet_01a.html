  </h1>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 1: Email your link to your Github page. The links should be of the
         form
         <pre>

             https://username.github.io/

         </pre>
         where the \lq\lq username\rq\rq\ is the name you chose when setting up
         your account. Your instructor should be able to clone or create a
         branch associated with your account.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 2: Email your instructor to indicate that you have created the 
         <pre>

             math4610

         </pre>
         repository on your account. Make sure that the repository is private
         and that the only other collaborator is the instructor for the class.
         The instructor email is contained in the syllabus for the course.
         <pre>

             https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/syllabus/md/syllabus

         </pre>
         or
         <pre>

             https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/syllabus/pdf/syllabus.pdf

         </pre>
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 3: Email your instructor as to which command line environment you
         will use in the course. Possible choices are: Cygwin, Linux, MacOS,
         or Windows.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 4: Write a code in the language you intend to use in the course
         that when executed will inform your instructor as to the language that
         will be used. Your instructor must be able to (1) open the code in a
         text editor, say Notepad, (2) compile the code, say using gcc, and (3)
         then run the executable to reveal the coding language to be used by the
         student.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 5: Email the instructor the link to the table of contents for your
         homework solutions. The link should be something like
         <pre>

             https://username.github.io/math4610/hw_toc

         </pre>
         Notice that the extension \lq\lq .md\rq\rq\ is not included if the file
         is a Markdown file.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 6: In class, an example of computational error involving
         derivatives was given. The approximation was given by a "oned-sided"
         difference quotient. Use a central difference of the form
         $$f'(x)\approx{{f(x+h)-f(x-h)}\over{(x+h)-(x-h)}}$$
         to document the same behavior where the error reduces as $h$ decreases
         until machine precision causes problems.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 7: Implement two separate routines to compute (1) the absolute
         error between a number and an approximation of that number and (2) the
         relative error between a number and an approximation of that number..
         Include separate entries in your software manual for the two routines
         you created in the previous task.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 8: Repeat the ideas in class of creating a shared library with the
         machine epsilon routines included in the library. Then include the
         absolute and relative error routines your created and documented in the
         software manual for the course. At this point, you should have a total
         of 4 routines in your shared library at this point in the course. If
         you have not written the two machine epsilon codes, do that as a part
         of this task.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 9: Write a main program that computes the derivative of the
         exponential function, $e^x$, at the point $x=\pi$. Link to your shared
         library and use the absolute and relative error routines to compute the
         errors. You can use either the one sided or centered difference
         approximation for this task.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 10: Search the internet for sites that discuss absolute and
         relative errors. Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4 sentences) that
         describe your findings. Include links to the sites you cite.
    </li>
