  </h1>

  <ul>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 1: Write a code that implements a Cholesky factorization of a real
         matrix. Include a check on the matrix to make sure it is symmetric. Put
         an entry in your software manual that documents the method.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 2: Write a method that implements Jacobi iteration for solving
         linear systems of equations. Put an entry in your software manual for
         this method.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 3: Write a routine that will create a square matrix with dimension
         $n$. Use a random number generator to determine the entries in the
         matrix. You can use a uniform distribution as the basis for the values
         created. Put a page in for this method. 
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 4: Repeat Task 3 with output that is diagonally dominant as
         defined in class.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 5: Repeat Task 3 with output that is a symmetric matrix.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 6: Repeat Task 3 with output that is both symmetric and
         diagonally dominant.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 7: Use each of the matrix generation routines with your Jacobi
         iteration to test the code. You should generate a matrix with
         dimension $n$ with $n$ large, create the right hand side of the system
         by multiplying the matrix on the left into a vector of ones. Then solve
         the resulting system. You solutions should be close to 1 if your
         Jacobi iteration is working.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 8: Implement the Gauss-Seidel method for solving linear systems of
         equations. Include a software manual page for this method.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 9: Run the Gauss-Seidel iteration on the same matrices as you
         created in Task 7. Compare the results of the Jacobi iteration runs to
         the Gauss-Seidel runs. This means keeping track of the number of
         iterations for each method.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 10: Search the internet for sites that document the use of
         Jacobi iteration and/or Gauss-Seidel. Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4
         sentences) that describe your findings. Include links to the sites you
         cite.
    </li>
