    Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics:
                         Tasksheet 7 Problem/Questions
  </h1>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 1: Implement the Method of Steepest Descent for solving linear
         systems of equations. Put an entry in your software manual that
         documents the method. Include an example using the diagonally dominant
         matrix generation routine from the previous tasksheet.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 2: Tryout your steepest descent method on a sequence of matrices
         based on the Hilbert matrix. Start with $n=4$ and see how far you can
         go increasing $n$.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 3: Implement the Conjugate Gradient method for solving linear
         systems of equations. Keep in mind that you will need to test the
         method on a symmetric, positive definite matrix. Create and include a
         software page for the conjugate gradient method in your software
         manual.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 4: As a test of the steepest descent method versus the conjugate
         gradient method, write code to do the following. First, generate a
         square symmetric diagonally dominant matrix - you have already created
         such a method. Then report the number of iterations required to produce
         a solution to the linear system. Generate the right hand side of the
         system of equations using
         $$
           {\bf b} = A\ {\bf v}
         $$
         where all the entries of ${\bf v}$ are 1.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 5: Compare your results in Task 4 to the use of Gaussian
         Elimination with backsubstitution. Report the amount of time it takes
         to compute the solution of the linear system for steepest descent, the
         conjugate gradient method, and Gaussian elimination.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 6: Repeat the work in Task 5 but use Jacobi iteration instead of
         Gaussian elimination. Again, which runs faster.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 7: Repeat Task 6 using Gauss-Seidel instead of Jacobi Iteration.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 8: Implement a matrix multiplication routine for a tridiagonal
         matrix that avoids as many computations with zeros as possible. Use the
         vector form of matrix storage to store the three nonzero diagonals.
         Create a software manual page for the method.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 9: Create an analogous routine where the matrix is penta-diagonal
         with two diagonals above and below the main diagonal of the matrix.
         Use 5 vectors to store the matrix. As always, document the method in
         your software manual. 
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 10: Search the internet for sites that document the use of
         conjugate gradient methods. Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4
         sentences) that describe your findings. Include links to the sites you
         cite.
    </li>
