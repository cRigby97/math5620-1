  <ul>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 1: Write code that implements the power method for finding the
         largest eigenvalue in magnitude of a square matrix. Document the method
         in your software manual page. Use a symmetric diagonally dominant
         matrix to test the method and include the results as an example in
         your software manual.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 2: Try out your power method on the Hilbert matrix of order
         $n=10$.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 3: Implement the inverse power method for finding the smallest
         eigenvalue of a square matrix. Use a symmetric diagonally dominant
         matrix to test the method and include the results as an example in
         your software manual.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 4: Try out your inverse power method on the Hilbert matrix of
         order $n=10$.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 5: Implement the power method with shifting to try to estimate
         eignevalues of a matrix. Include a page in your software manual. Try
         to find as eigenvalues not equal to the largest or smallest. Use a
         symmetric diagonally dominant matrix to test the code.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 6: Try out your shifted power method on the Hilbert matrix of
         order $n=10$.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 7: Knowing that the condition number a matrix in the 2-norm is
         related to the largest and smallest eigenvalues, write a routine that
         will compute an estimate of the 2-condition number using the power
         method and inverse power method.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 8: Try out the condition number code on the Hilber matrix for
         $n=10$. Does this work?
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 9: Combine the tridiagonal matrix multiplication routine to
         compute the 2-condition number of a tridiagonal matrix. Use a symmetric
         diagonally dominant tridiagonal matrix to test the code. Use a 
         tridiagonal matrix with $n=10, 100, 1000, 10,000$. Report the results
         including execution time.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 10: Search the internet for sites that document the use of
         Power iteration and/or Inverse Power Iteration. Write a brief
         paragraph (3 or 4 sentences) that describe your findings. Include
         links to the sites you cite.
    </li>
