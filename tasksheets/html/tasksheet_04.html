    Math 5620 Numerical Methods for the Approximate Solution of Differential
       Equations: Tasksheet 4 Problem/Questions
  </h1>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 1: Write a finite difference code for the elliptic problem
         \[
           ( k(x)\ u')' = f(x)
         \]
         on $[0,1]$. Use the Gaussian elimination routine that you developed for
         your first elliptic solver to solve the resulting linear system of
         equations. Test your code in the case when the coefficient, $k(x)$, is
         a constant. This should produce the same results as in your previous
         tasks.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 2: In class we will see how to perform a computational convergence
         analysis. Do this on the constant coefficient case where homogeneous
         Dirichlet conditions are imposed. Note that you will need an exact
         solution for the problem. If $f(x)=x-x^2$, determine an exact solution
         for this task.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 3: Repeat the previous task for the case when the coefficient
         is specified as $k(x)=sin(\pi x)$.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 4: Use $f$ and homogeneous Dirichlet conditions in this task. 
         Use the array of values provided by your instructor to represent the
         coefficient function, $k(x)$. This may require that you modify your
         code to handle an array over a function definition.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 5: Build software manual pages for the elliptic solver codes you
         have written so far.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 6: Search the internet for discussions of using finite difference
         methods to handle a nonconstant coefficient function. That is, find
         sites for elliptic problems of the form
         \[
            ( k(x)\ u' )' = f
         \] 
         with with any type of boundary conditions. Write a brief paragraph (3
         or 4 sentences) that describes your findings. Include links to the
         sites you cite.
