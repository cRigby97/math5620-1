    Math 5620 Numerical Methods for the Approximate Solution of Differential
       Equations: Tasksheet 1 Problem/Questions
  </h1>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 1: Email the link to your Github page. The links should be of the
         form
         <pre>

             https://username.github.io/

         </pre>
         where the \lq\lq username\rq\rq\ is the name you chose when setting up
         your Github account. Your instructor should be able to clone or create
         a branch associated with your account.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 2: Email your instructor to indicate that you have created the 
         <pre>

             math5620

         </pre>
         repository on your account. Make sure that the repository is private
         and that the only other collaborator is your instructor for the class.
         The instructor email is contained in the syllabus for the course.
         <pre>

             https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math5620/syllabus/md/syllabus

         </pre>
         or
         <pre>

             https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math5620/syllabus/pdf/syllabus.pdf

         </pre>
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 3: Email your instructor as to which command line environment you
         will use in the course. Possible choices are: Cygwin, Linux, MacOS,
         or Windows.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 4: Write a code in the language you intend to use in the course
         that when executed will inform your instructor as to the language that
         will be used. Your instructor must be able to (1) open the code in a
         text editor, say Notepad, (2) compile the code, say using gcc, and (3)
         then run the executable to reveal the coding language to be used by the
         student.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 5: Email the instructor the link to the table of contents for your
         homework solutions. The link should be something like
         <pre>

             https://username.github.io/math5620/hw_toc

         </pre>
         Notice that the extension \lq\lq .md\rq\rq\ is not included if the file
         is a Markdown file.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 6: Search the internet for sites that discuss difference quotient
         approximations of derivatives and applications where these
         approximations are used. Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4 sentences)
         that describe your findings. Include links to the sites you cite.
    </li>
    <hr>
  </ul>
