    Math 5620 Numerical Methods for the Approximate Solution of Differential
       Equations: Tasksheet 6 Problem/Questions
  </h1>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 1: Write a code that solves the Poisson equation where the linear
         solver used is Gauss-Seidel. So, use the equation
         \[
            \Delta\ u = {{\partial u}\over{\partial x^2}}
                             + {{\partial u}\over{\partial y^2}} = f(x,y)
         \]
         with \(f(x,y)=xy\) and homogeneous boundary conditions.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 2: Write a code to solve a linear system of equations using the
         conjugate gradient method. For a test case, use the matrix for the
         Poisson equation. Use the methodology discussed in class to test the
         method. That is, generate a right hand side from a vector of ones in
         the specification of the linear system.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 3: Solve
         \[
            \Delta\ u = {{\partial u}\over{\partial x^2}}
                             + {{\partial u}\over{\partial y^2}} = f(x,y)
         \]
         with \(f(x,y)=xy\) and homogeneous boundary conditions. Use at least
         three different mesh sizes, say \(h=0.1\), \(h=0.01\), and \(h=0.001\)
         for the test.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 4: Build routines that will assemble the matrix for a nine point
         stencil. Also build a code that will create the right hand side for
         the Poisson equation.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 5: Build a code using previously created codes that will compute
         an approximate solution for the Poisson equation using a 9 point
         stencil for the Poisson equation in Task 1.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 6: Search the internet for articles that compare 5 point stencil
         finite difference approximations and 9 point stencil finite difference
         approximations. Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4 sentences) that
         describes your findings. Include links to the sites you cite.
